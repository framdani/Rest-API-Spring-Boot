# Rest-API-Spring-Boot
This is my first application using Spring Boot. In order to get familiar with web services and Rest API, I will implement an example of CRUD operations.

### Objectives
- [x] Implementing basic user services.
- [x] Generic exception handling for all resources.
- [x] validations for Restful services.
- [x] HATEOAS and content-negotiation for XML.
- [ ] Auto generation of Swagger documentation.
- [ ] Authentication with Spring Security.
